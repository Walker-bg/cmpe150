# You will be given the elements of A set with N elements 
# and B set with M elements (2 <= N, M <= 100). Write the 
# program that finds the elements of the A-B set. In the 
# first line of the entry, the number N will be given, 
# followed by the elements of the A set. In the second line, 
# first the number M, then the elements of the set B will 
# be given. When printing the result on the output, you 
# must print the elements in the order they appear in 
# set A. Intersections are guaranteed not to be empty sets. 
# Set elements will only consist of alphabet letters and numbers.

#Input: 9 a b c d e 1 2 3 4

#Output: a b 1 2 3 4

#Input: 3 a b c
#       2 b a
#Output: c
